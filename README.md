# Zipf visualization

<p>Based on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCn8zs912OEt=827">Vsauce video</a> about Zipf's Law, he proposed a simple experiment to test it. </p>
	<p>We generate some random numbers, and on each iteration, we "bind" those numbers together to chain. On next iteration, if the new random numbers are
		already in a chain, we chain them together. After some iterations, the total length of the chains follow the Zipf's Law.
